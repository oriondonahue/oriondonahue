hello,
i am a horticultural professional with a background in environmental science and microbiology. previously i studied the potential use of mealworms to breakdown styrofoam waste and created a pocket guide to wild yeast cultivation.

these days i take care of plants in central park, i am primarily responsible for the care of the north meadow butterfly gardens https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/north-meadow-butterfly-gardens, I became an ISA certified arborist in 2023 to formalize my knowledge of tree care. to aid me in my day to day i sometimes make maps and tools.
